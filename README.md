# cookies
An example project for teaching MVC using plain PHP and Javascript. 

Note this is NOT meant to be deployed to a production server as there are unaddressed security and deployment concerns.

# Setup
You'll need to have a XAMP server running on your machine. 
You can get that here
* for windows http://www.wampserver.com/en/
* for mac https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/

Clone this repo inside your 'www' folder of you XAMP stack

Be sure to add the folder to the include_path in the php.ini config file.

You'll also want to seed the database a little bit. I'll add a seed script at a later point, but you'll at least want to add 
the four tables, as well as seed some cookies.
